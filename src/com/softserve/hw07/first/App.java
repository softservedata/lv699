////    Create Payment interface with the method calculatePay(), the base class Employee with a string variable employeeld.
////    Create two classes SalariedEmployee and ContractEmployee, which implement interface and are inherited from the base class.
////    Describe hourly paid workers in the relevant classes (one of the children), and fixed paid workers (second child).
////    Describe the string variable socialSecurityNumber in the class SalariedEmployee .
////    Include a description of federalTaxIdmember in the class of ContractEmployee.
////    The calculation formula for the "time-workerâ€œ is: the average monthly
////    salary = hourly rate * number of hours worked
////    For employees with a fixed payment the formula is: the average monthly 	salary = fixed monthly payment
////    Create an array of employees and add the employees with different form of payment.
