Europe follows next behind Asia in terms of the popularity of the use of SMS.
In 2003, an average of 16 billion messages was sent each month.
Users in Spain sent a little more than fifty messages per month on average in 2003.
In Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, the figure was around 35–40 SMS messages per month.
In each of these countries, the cost of sending an SMS message varies from ˆ0.04–0.23, depending on the payment plan (with many contractual plans including all or several texts for free).
In the United Kingdom, text messages are charged between $0.05–0.12.
Curiously, France has not taken to SMS in the same way, sending just under 20 messages on average per user per month.
France has the same GSM technology as other European countries, so the uptake is not hampered by technical restrictions.
